tags: ['Leetcode', 'Dynamic Programming']
draft: false
summary: 'You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.'

```typescript
/**
 * Because houses are arranged in a circle
 * If we rob the first house, then we can't rob the last house
 * If we rob the last house, then we can't rob the first house
 * Run house robber algorithm on arr[0, -1] and on arr[1, arr.length] 
 * return the max value
